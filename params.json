Allowing functionality to be quickly added. Simply respond to the env if needed.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\nLet us take Commands as an example. Commands has also been implemented as a middlware, it's middleware all the way down. Any call to Fabio-Worker will pass through Commands, it will also pass through Ping and Info. It will pass through all included Middlewares, so only act if required. \r\n```\r\n# e.g env = { :cmd => :info }\r\nStack\r\n-> Commands\r\n  -> Ping \r\n  -> Info *responds*\r\n-> Environment\r\n  -> RVM\r\n  -> Bundler\r\n-> Repositories\r\n  -> CVS\r\n  -> Git\r\n-> Executors\r\n  -> Ant\r\n  -> Rake\r\n-> Reporters\r\n  -> Reporter\r\n```\r\nNote: this the global stack example, a Top level stack may pass messages differently. (Not currently the case)\r\n\r\n# Why?\r\nMain goal is to create a simple and extendable remote build system. One which can easily be executed on most platforms (ruby, or jruby).\r\n\r\n# Core concepts\r\nAlways #call on, never stop the chain early. Call with empty if required.  \r\nDefault your arguments where it makes sense, use the most logical default choice (i.e git with no operation is checkout)  \r\n\r\n","name":"Fabio"}
